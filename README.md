# DB2Scripts
Scripts used to manage Db2 LUW databases
These scripts expect a file structure like
<pre>
---- scripts
 |
  ---sql
</pre>
  i.e. a scripts directory and a sql directory created at the same level in a file system
  
  This is required as the scripts will use relative directory structures to find files. All .sql files should be placed in the sql directory and all other files placed in the scripts directory
